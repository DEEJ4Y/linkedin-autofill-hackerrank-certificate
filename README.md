## Issues

- Date: The month/year of the certificate is only available on the certificate image, drawn on an `HTML canvas element`. By default, current month/year are entered into the fields.
- Issuing Organization: Plain text `HackerRank` is pasted into the input element. An additional button click (Yes), is required to map `HackerRank` to a Linkedin organization.
